            <p id="aboutYaneizy">Yaneizy Castillo is a student at Flatiron School who needed to create her own app within 3 weeks span. The main requirements were that the back-end needed to be solely based off Ruby on Rails and the front-end off of JavaScript React. This app ties all the knowledge applied from all 4 phases (3 months) and finish line for graduation! This is her first ever solo project and can’t wait to create more in the near future!</p>

            <h2 id="h2">The Meaning Behind Creating Sabrosa</h2>

            <p>There has not been a moment when I haven’t looked up to my family as role models. With the bravery my grandma, Mama Yoly, risked to emigrate to American from Guatemala by herself, has always set an example that I could do anything. My three aunts and two uncles have paved the way for my cousins, sibling, and I that determination, hard work, and family, will always get you far in life. With us being a close knit family of 14, food will always be a key to our hearts. Everyone within my family has that one special dish that they are known for and when we ask how they make it … phewwww it is a laborious. We only listen when they describe the process. At random times of craving a particular family member’s dish, I never knew the steps of how to make it. 
            {/* MAYBE MAKE A NEW P TAG */}
            I’ve always wanted to make a literal cookbook … but we’re living in the 21st century where we can make things are everlasting and easier! That’s how Sabrosa came about! I wanted make a cookbook where all my cousins, sibling, and I can continue making infamous family dishes for future generations to come. It’s great because I can always make my mom’s infamous flan hehe!
            {/* MAYBE MAKE A NEW P TAG */}
            My family never got to see me graduate high school during the 2020 Pandemic, so I hope this app is a better way of celebrating another mile stone within my career along side of them.</p>

            <h2 id="h3">Sabrosa Name Meaning</h2>
            <p>My grandma doesn't go by her first name, Rosa, since we grew up with her nickname of Mami Yoly. I believe that her name is very beautiful and many of my cousins didn't know until I told them. I knew that I wanted to incorporate a family name within the name. I also wanted my app name to be in spanish but not a word that may be diffcicult to pronounce. Since the app revolves around food, sabrosa is perfect word to describe the deliciousness. It happened to be fate that Sabrosa was the perfect word to be used!</p>
